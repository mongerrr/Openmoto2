# OpenMoto Piston Dock

The files in this folder can be used to 3D print an insert to turn an old piston into a phone dock. The geometry in the files above would suit a KTM 200EXC piston, but could be easily modified to suit a range of bikes.

If you have any suggestions, feedback, or pictures of your 3D print, feel free to post it using the "Issues" link above

## Instructions
### Instructions For Printing
If you would just like to 3d print this part, use the "piston_dock.stl" and "wrist-pin.stl" files. If you don't have your own 3D printer, I would recommend using [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com), as you can get good quality prints for a reasonable price.

### Instructions For Modification

If you would like to make your piston dock, feel free to make changes to suit the size of your piston
To do this;
- Use the download link to get all the files in this folder
- Extract the files from the zip folder
- Open "piston_dock.scad" and "wrist-pin.scad" using [Openscad](http://www.openscad.org/)
- Once you have made your changes, export the model as an stl
- To make the stl ready to print, use a tool like [Meshlab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) to clean up any irregularities in the stl file

The key measurements needed for the model are;
- Inner diameter of the piston
- Diameter of the wrist pin
- Depth of the inside of the piston
- Depth to the top of the wrist pin holding area (Does this have a proper name?)
- Gap between the wrist pin holding areas

Other numbers in the model are to adjust the position and size of the cable slots and the back support for the phone.
